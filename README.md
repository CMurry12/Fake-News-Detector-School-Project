after that make sure that these files are in the same directory

The data folder has to be in the same folder as all the exactuables

fake_news_CNN.py and Fake_news_BiLSTM.py need to be in the same folder as shared_preprocessing.py
fake_news_text_CNN_lair.py and Fake_news_BiLSTM_liar.py need to be in the same folder as liar_preprocessing.py
fake_news_news_samples_CNN.py and Fake_news_BiLSTM_news_sample.py need to be in the same folder as shared_preprocessing_news_samples.py

After that, you should be able to just run the program through a code editor, or terminal

terminal instructions:
navigate to where it is in terminal that run the python command and the file name,
